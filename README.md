# 2048DBZ
A DBZ-themed fork of [2048](http://git.io/2048), based on an idea by Mariano Salerno, Pablo de Haro, Claudio Fernandez, Manu Gambino, and ourselves.

Made just _because we can_ :) [Play it here!](http://mgarciaisaia.github.io/2048dbz/)

## Donations
We made this because we can, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means we don't have any hosting costs), and it was almost the same as Gabriele done, so if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`. Thank you very much!
